Technology has changed everything in our lives. It influences our ways of communication, education, transportation, and really our lifestyles. With today's technology we can earn a college degree in the comfort of our own home.
We can meet and collaborate with our teachers and classmates from all over the world via video conferencing. Having FaceBook, WhatsApp and our smart phones as our tools of communication we no longer need to write a letter or a fax to communicate with others. Now that we have Uber and Lyft, we no longer need to have a driver license to get to work, school, grocery, or hang out with friends. If we are too lazy or too busy to cook or eat out we can always turn to UberEats and DoorDash. 

I live in the Silicon Valley my whole life and I have seen technology have evolved itself into many different levels. Almost everytime it changes it was better than the last and this will never stop. I've always been surrounded by technology and its' magic. Growing up, I've always been the one wanting to try getting things done a different way. 
I don't like to take things the easy way I like to challenge myself. Going through high school I had an idea of becoming a computer scientist like the rest of my friends. But then life happens, I started working really younger and was really good at what I was doing. I built my first career working as a Food and Beverage Manager 13 years. I was getting to comfortable to I decided that I wanted to become and entrepreneur. I wanted to build something from the ground up, some of my own. So then I created my first baby, it was a Boba Tea shop. I opened my shop in 2016 and it is now self-sustaining. I think to myself it is time. I want to make magic happens too! I want to create Apps, softwares, programs to make things easier and nicer for people. After months of consideration and research I wanted to become a Data Scientist. But with further research I've decided to start with becoming a Software engineer then transition into Data Scientist.
